To implement:
1. Feedback Net module
2. Plotting module
2. Edge case when no samples have a score that passes the threshold for all features

Issues:
1. There is just a very few samples added to the discriminator during each step,
 the increase of  is about 5% per epoch (batch size = 264, 10 steps per epoch) which means that the discriminator
 might never see these samples (due to batching and limited step per epoch).

    Possible workarounds:
     a. THIS WORKED: limit the number of sequences inputted to the FB-GAN to as low as 2000
     b. decrease threshold altogether
     c. decrease threshold at first and increase with each epoch/step
     d. average the score out? To get sequences that might have say 5/6 desired features but miss one?
